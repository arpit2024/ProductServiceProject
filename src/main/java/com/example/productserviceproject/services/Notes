since our 1st part of project we implemented api to call 3rd party APi
as we used Fakestore Api to get products and categories details from DB

For this reason we used interface in our Service package so that we can implement it
whenever required, now in service package we will create another class- SelfProductService

now we will implement our own api to get products and categories details from DB
as soon as we implement all interface methods we will get below error

APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Parameter 0 of constructor in com.example.productserviceproject.controller.ProductController
required a single bean, but 2 were found:

	- fakeStoreProductService: defined in file [C:\Users\ADMIN\IdeaProjects\ProductServiceProject\
	target\classes\com\example\productserviceproject\services\FakeStoreProductService.class]

	- myProductService: defined in file [C:\Users\ADMIN\IdeaProjects\ProductServiceProject\target\classes\com\
	example\productserviceproject\services\MyProductService.class]


so in springs context we have both beans available, so we need to tell spring which bean to use
we have selfProductservice and FakestoreProductService objects.

Now Product controller ask spring , hey spring please give me an object of Product Service-
but spring is confused which object to give, so we need to tell spring which object to give- its called an ambiguous State

in Simple words:-
Controller is dependent upon interface, but there are 2 object that are implementing this interface,thate why spring is confused

How to solve it?
->we can annotate the class with @Primary,then whenever spring is confused it will give the object which is annotated with @Primary
But still we can say what if Both are annotated with @Primary, then we can use @Qualifier annotation

we can give name to our Service class
@Service("SelfProductService")
and wherever I need in controller we can use @Qualifier("SelfProductService") within constructor of controller.

Noe there will be no confusion for spring, it will give the object which is annotated with @Qualifier("SelfProductService")


Summary:-
so when spring is storing these beans in its context, it will store with the name of class
so when we are asking for object of Product Service, spring will give the object which is annotated with @Qualifier("SelfProductService")


Q)what is benefit, we can directly use selfProduct service in constructor of controller
As per question code is dependent on class not on interface,
But we are using interface, so that we can use any service class in future, we can use FakeStoreProductService also
just @Autowired
         public ProductController(@Qualifier("FakeStoreProductService")ProductService productService){
             this.productService=productService;
         }
our code is not dependent on any implementation.



Similarly we can do the same for Category Service also-As Repository is dependent on Model
