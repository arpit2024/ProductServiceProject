getSingleProduct()- Implementing First API Method

Do i have a object of Product repository>-> YES

In the Product Repository what method do i need to write that will allow me to getSingleProduct
->findById
Product FindById(Long id)- write this method in Product Repository

Q) so what if we don't have this Product Id in our database
->this will return Null

Now The problem with  null is that it will throw an exception,
Ex:- in our case we are trying to get the product by id, but if we don't have that product
in our database then it will return null and if we try to access the null object then it will
throw an exception

in selfProductService class we have a method called getSingleProduct()
in this method we are calling the findById() method of ProductRepository
        Product product =ProductRepository.findById(id);// id=1L

and this method will return a Product object as null
if i try to access the null say  product.getTitle() then it will throw an exception- null pointer exception

*) So we need to do things that can be checked at compile time,
-> so instead of just returning the Product object we can return Optional<Product> object
write this method

1) in Product Repository
    Optional<Product> FindById(Long id) ->

2) In SelfProductService
    Optional<Product> proOptional =ProductRepository.findById(id);// id=1L
    if(proOptional.isPresent()){
        Product pro = proOptional.get();
    }
    else{
        //throw exception
    }

    OR

    if(proOptional.isEmpty()){
        //throw exception
        throw new ProductNotFoundException("Product with id "+id+" not found");
    }
    else{
        Product pro = proOptional.get();
    }
    return pro


Q) if we can check before applying findById say to stop getting exception?
-> yes we can check if the product is present in the database or not by using the
            method ProductRepository.existsById()
But this will lead to two database calls,
1) one for checking if the product is present or not
2) second for getting the product by id ->FindById() method

Note:- getBy returns Entity, findBy returns Optional<Entity>

Q) Why we created findById when JpaRepository provides it by default?
-> Its a good practice to create our own method in the repository
-> we can write our own logic in the method, like we can write a method that will return

Lets say tomorrow we want to move from JPA to ourself writing DB queries(Imagine we are Moving to DB that JPA does not support)
then we can write our own logic in the method

Q) for a list of product how we can check?
-> for a list of product can never be null, it can be empty
we will get a empty List

Q) what if we want to get a list of product by category id?
-> we can write a method in ProductRepository
    List<Product> findByCategoryId(Long id);

Q) what if we want to get a list of product by category id and active?
-> we can write a method in ProductRepository
    List<Product> findByCategoryIdAndActive(Long id,boolean active);
